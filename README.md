This project utilizes OpenCV to capture selfies when a smiling face is detected through your computer's webcam. The code uses Haar cascades for both face and smile detection to identify and locate faces and smiles in real-time video frames.

**Dependencies**
Python
OpenCV

**Usage**
Run the script
python Automatic_selfie_capture.py

The live video window will open, and the program will capture selfies when it detects a smiling face.
Press 'q' to exit the program.

**Notes**
Make sure to have a stable webcam connection for optimal results.
Adjust the parameters for face and smile detection in the code if needed.
The captured selfies will be saved to the specified directory.
